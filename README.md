## Magnus
Let there be n players in a chess tournament. Each player plays a game with every other player. A
result can be either win, tie or loss. One can ask a question in the form of “Did ‘i’ win against ‘j’?”.
The answer could be either “Yes” or “No”.
A player will be given the title of “MAGNUS” if he/she wins against every other player. Design an
algorithm that is allowed to ask a question in the form prescribed only. which will output a player who
is “MAGNUS”, if exists, else “NO MAGNUS”.

## One_to_one_and_OnTo_Mapping
Let f be a map that maps a finite set A into itself (i.e. every element of A is mapped to another
element of A). For simplicity, we denote the elements of A by the integers 1 to n.
Given a finite set A and a mapping from A to itself, find a subset S ⊆ A with the maximum number of
elements, such that (1) the function f maps every element of S to another element of S (i.e., f maps S
into itself), and (2) no two elements of S are mapped to the same element (i.e., f is one-to-one when
restricted to S).
